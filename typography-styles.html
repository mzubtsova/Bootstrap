    <p class="lead">While robots have evolved to be able to do pretty much anything, most androids and bots work in the
        construction and manufacturing field as force multipliers. As experts in lifting, moving, and nuts-and-bolting, the
        robotic population is an ideal match for industry and repetitive tasks. As they say in the trades, there’s nothing
        as fun as ennui! And that’s why we strive for our employees to have the most tedious occupations in the world. Are
        you ready to join us?</p>
    <p>Mind Numbing Products is a force in the manufacturing and production market, having produced and manufactured nearly
        every kind of product ever. Our motto is If it’s not Mind Numbing, it’s not worth it.</p>
    <p>This year, the Binaryville Medallion of Honor will be presented to our very own Rivet for his tireless disaster
        relief work in collusion with The Ultimate Robot Disaster Relief Organized Organization, TURDROO [tooltip:
        pronounced ‘TUR-drew’]. Despite his chronic alektorophobia [tooltip: fear of chickens], Rivet has also gone beyond
        binary boundaries, dedicating every Thursday afternoon to egg-sitting for neighborhood fowl as they foray into town
        for grain and karaoke. </p>
